What we can do for your organisation?

### UX Design
At {{ metadata.company }} we can look at your current service or even create something new that has the user at the very heart of the project. We don't just hide in a room for a few weeks and send you some final designs, we will want to meet with you, work with you, understand your users, understand their needs and how your service fits.

Some things are really obvious at first glance and others take time and research to understand your users behaviour. We partner with great user researchers to get to the very bottom of what your users are doing, thinking and expecting from your service. Sometimes it's hard to hear the truth about your service but we can help you pivot to an alternative solution.

Our UX Design service is not bound to a digital screen, it could be a simple letter, telephone system or a whole holiday experience from door to hotel door (see service design).

### UI Design
Do you just want shiny things then we do that too. We can design or redesign your current service based on your requirements. We'll always try and sprinkle our expertise in UX design to help improve how your site works...we just can't help ourselves.

### Service Design
We can look at your whole service from end to end. A user doesn't start and end their journey through your service as soon as they visit and leave your website. At {{ metadata.company }} we consider the before, after and all those other intricate layers that make up your service. We can evaluate how your service currently works by talking to your experts and with additional research we can understand where your users are really struggling. This leads nicely back to our UX design service for a full end to end redesign.

<!-- ### Accessibility Audit
We can offer an accessibilty audit of your service if you need one. Whatever your needs are we're not judgy...even if it's because you need to tick a box for an assessment then that works for us.
