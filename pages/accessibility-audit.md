If you're unsure whether your service is accessible to all users then we can help by running an accessibility audit over your entire app/website.

We will work on the basis that you want to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards rather than AAA and we will check against these stardards.

#### Wait, there's a higher standard...lets go for that
WCAG 2.1 AAA standard is an extremely hard target to meet. That's not to say it shouldn't be reached for and we will always highlight anything we know that meets the AAA standard.

You will often find that the design of your service will need to be drastically altered to meet AAA and we can save you that time and money by saying WCAG 2.1 AA is a great achievement for any service.

#### Who is this for?
Ideally your service should be accessible for all users...in fact all public facing government websites require an accessibilty statement since 2018, but we know budget constraints and an ever changing priority can push those accessible tweaks further down the list of things to do.

It may be that you want to make sure everyone can access your services or you've been told to tick a box. Ideally we hope it's the first option but any improvement from an accessibilty point of view is better than no improvement so no shaming here.

#### How much does this cost?
~~Hw loong is a piece of string~~ We try and offer a flat rate but we know that not all websites are the same, some small and complex and others are huge and simple. To make sure we're offering a fair price we will ask for some details about your service such as how many pages, are there any key pages that are more complex.

#### You still haven't told us how much it will cost?
You've got me there, okay so lets say you have a 4 page marketing page with a home, about, services, contact...so just like the site you're on now then we could create an audit report for £250.

If you have an ecommerce platform with a large checkout system, user logins and various bells and whistles then we could be looking at £1000.

#### What do we get?
You will get a report highlighting where your service meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards and where your service fails the standard. We will give you an indicator of low / medium / high and potential fixes.
