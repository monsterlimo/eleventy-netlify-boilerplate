As an interaction designer or UX designer working in the public sector there is a strong likelyhood that you will need to create interactive prototypes using the Gov.uk prototype kit. This can be a daunting prospect for many designers who then find themselves needing to quickly learn how to code a working prototype for a live project.

Our interaction designer training will help you get up to speed with the prototype kit as well as cover some basic principles when working in the public sector.
