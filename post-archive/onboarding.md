Mission: Allows organisations to quickly develop and use NHS login

NHS login is a reusable service to access many health applications and sites.

We made It easy for organisations to consume information about NHS login to understand whether it is right for them. 

We targeted the decision makers and the developers as two major users groups.

Status: Live - since updated

Users: Developers, CEOâ€™s, Product Owners and more.


I lead the design and the research for the onboarding solution, including prototyping, researching planning and running research sessions.

My main tasks were balancing the research requirements and the prototyping needed to test.

Within developers we found two core groups:
Those that skim the documentation, they want to get it working quickly.

Those that dive, they need to know as much before they touch any code.
