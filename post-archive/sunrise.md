Mission: ---

Sunrise is an in-house artwork approval tool which is also used by Bacard, Aldi, Asda and Reckitt Benkeiser and also internally.

My role initially in the organisation was to work on development features as part of an agile team. 

As the project evolved I moved closer to the front end with a focus on improving the user experience.

I introduced user research to the organisation.
