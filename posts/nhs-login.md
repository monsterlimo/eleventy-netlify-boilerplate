Mission: Allow users to safely and securely access information about their health

NHS login is the primary health ID verification service in England. It serves as the authentication that allows users to access the NHS App and other health services with the use of their thumb print.

I worked on the NHS login project for over two years covering initial prototypes that combined GOV.Verify to help create a health based ID verification tool.

The service needed to work on many different devices and services but we started with mobile first and tested with a wide variety of users from the public.
