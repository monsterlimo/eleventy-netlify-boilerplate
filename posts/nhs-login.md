Mission: allow users to safely and securely access information about their healthNHS login is the primary health ID verification service in England.

It serves as the authentication that allows users to access the NHS App and other health services with the use of their thumb print.

I worked on the NHS login project for over two years covering initial prototypes that combined GOV.Verify to helping create a health based ID verification tool.

## Core product

NHS logins first major health service was the NHS App.

The service needed to work on many different devices and services but we started with mobile first.

Using the large post-it notes (bottom right) allows me to quickly design on a size similar to an iPhone.

Our service needed to work for all users and we would try different ways to help users who needed a different way to prove who they are (top left)
