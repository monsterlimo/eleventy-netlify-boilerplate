Delegated access allows another person to act on another personsâ€™ behalf.

As part of NHS login I was involved in the discovery that focused on solving the problem of allowing 9 million carers to help care for another person digitally.

We found many fundamental issues around proving you care for another and that a large proportion of carers do not use any digital health services.


The project was restarted but with a renewed focus on building an MVP that focused on the easiest flow - giving consent to another person to act on your behalf.

I created service blueprints, prototypes and helped write user research plans and guides.

We tested with patients who manage another persons health, eg a spouse who picks up prescriptions


Delegated access would allow a person to share access to a digital health site or app.

We created prototypes for the user giving access and the user accepting the request.

The information needed to be clear so that a person accepting a request would understand what they were agreeing to.
