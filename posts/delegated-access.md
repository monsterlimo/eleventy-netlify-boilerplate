Mission: Allow a person to manage another personsâ€™ health digitally .

As part of NHS login I was involved in a discovery that focused on solving the problem of allowing 9 million carers to help care for another person digitally, not a small problem at all.

We found many fundamental issues around proving that you have the right to care for another person and that a large proportion of carers do not use any digital health services.

I created service blueprints, prototypes and helped write user research plans and guides. We tested with patients who manage another persons health, eg a spouse who picks up prescriptions.
