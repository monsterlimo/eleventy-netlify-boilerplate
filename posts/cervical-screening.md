Mission: Safely and securely replace a 30 year old system

The main focus on this project was the first step in a complete redesign of all screening services for the NHS...including breast, bowel and child immunisation.

The pressure to replace a system due to be decommissioned meant that the scope was initially ‘like for like’ but we knew that there had to be improvements made from a user experience point of view. We used the NHS.UK Service Manual whilst also factoring in that this manual has been designed for patient faces services so we needed to adjust to suit or admin users. 

## Patient Summary

The patient summary culminates a single page of information which previously required the user to find on more than 3 different systems.

The same page has been designed to work for all users who would previously use very different systems including terminals.

## Prior Notification

The Prior Notification List is a legacy function that holds patients before they are invited for screening. GP practice staff check their GP system to confirm whether a patient will be invited for screening.

We removed manual validation and mapped to the Public Health England guidance to reduce risk.
