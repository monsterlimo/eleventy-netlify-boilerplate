Mission: safely and securely replace a 30 year old system

The main focus on this project was the first step in a complete redesign of all screening throughout the whole of the NHS including breast, bowel and child immunisations.

Pressure to replace a system due to be decommissioned meant that the scope was initially ‘like for like’ but straight away using the NHS.UK Service Manual it was clear that it would be more than a straight swap of systems.

Working with stakeholders from Public Health England, NHS England and NHSx.

Researching with users from GP practices, hospitals and the administrative services.

Creating prototypes using the NHS.UK prototype kit

Leading the design for key features ‘Patient Summary’ and ‘Prior Notification’


## Patient Summary

The patient summary culminates a single page of information which previously required the user to find on more than 3 different systems.

The same page has been designed to work for all users who would previously use very different systems including the terminal view (top)

Status: Ready for deployment

Users: Sample taker, lab technician or administrative users

## Prior Notification

The Prior Notification List is a legacy function that holds patients before they are invited for screening.

GP practice staff check their GP system to confirm whether a patient will be invited for screening.

We removed manual validation and mapped to the Public Health England guidance to reduce risk.

Status: In development

Users: GP practice staff
